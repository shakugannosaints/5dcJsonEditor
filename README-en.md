## JSON Format Specification

The editor supports the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "Name": "Game Name",
  "Author": "Author Name",
  "Timelines": {
    "-1L": [
      "3k1/5/5/2K2/5"
    ],
    "0L": [
      "3k1/5/5/2K2/5"
    ],
    "+0L": [
      null, "8/8/8/8/8/8/8/8"
    ]
  },
  "CosmeticTurnOffset": -1
}
```

- `Name`: Game name
- `Author`: Author name
- `Timelines`: Object containing multiple timelines
  - Keys are timeline IDs (e.g., "-1L", "0L", "+0L")
  - Values are arrays of chessboard states, each element being a FEN string or `null`
- `CosmeticTurnOffset`: Turn offset value

## Project Structure

- `src/components/`: UI components
- `src/context/`: State management
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `public/`: Static assets

## Technology Stack

- React + TypeScript
- React DnD (drag and drop functionality)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

- Special "+0L" and "-0L" timelines require special handling
- Imported JSON files must conform to the specified format
